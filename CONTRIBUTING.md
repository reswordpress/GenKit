# GenKit Contributing Guidelines

GenKit is maintained by UpTech Labs.  But it is also a community effort.  Yes, it's open source and ready for you to join in and contribute.  Whether it's fixing a bug, developing a new module, designing a new interface, or just helping out with the documentation, you help to make GenKit the best development kit for the Genesis framework.

## Issues
Open an issue for any problems that you may have with the framework.  Try to be as specific as possible to help us out in replicating the problem.  Give us details about the environment, browser, operating system, and specific feature or component.  And we really dig it when you provide some helpful clues or even suggested root causes.

If we have questions, don't worry, as we'll reach out and ask you.
